# 🌍 Decentralized Supply Chain Transparency

Welcome to a revolutionary platform for ensuring ethical and transparent supply chains using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts. This project empowers companies, suppliers, and consumers to verify the origin, production, and distribution of goods, combating issues like forced labor, environmental harm, and counterfeit products.

## ✨ Features

🔍 **Traceable Product Journey**: Track every step of a product's lifecycle, from raw material to final sale.  
📜 **Immutable Records**: Store tamper-proof data on the blockchain for trust and accountability.  
✅ **Ethical Verification**: Verify compliance with ethical and sustainable standards.  
🤝 **Stakeholder Access**: Allow suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers to interact with the system.  
🚫 **Counterfeit Prevention**: Ensure product authenticity through unique identifiers.  
📊 **Auditability**: Provide regulators and auditors with transparent access to supply chain data.

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Suppliers**  
- Register raw materials or components with a unique product ID and hash.  
- Submit certifications (e.g., fair trade, organic) to prove ethical sourcing.  
- Update production stages as materials move through the supply chain.

**For Manufacturers**  
- Add manufacturing details (e.g., factory location, production date) to the product record.  
- Verify supplier data to ensure compliance with ethical standards.  
- Register finished products with unique identifiers.

**For Consumers**  
- Scan a product’s QR code to view its full supply chain history.  
- Verify authenticity and ethical certifications.  

**For Auditors/Regulators**  
- Access immutable supply chain records to ensure compliance.  
- Verify certifications and detect discrepancies.

## 📚 Smart Contracts (6 Total)

1. **ProductRegistry.clar**  
   Registers products with unique IDs, hashes, and metadata (e.g., origin, material details). Prevents duplicate registrations.

2. **SupplierRegistry.clar**  
   Manages supplier profiles, including certifications and verification status. Only verified suppliers can register products.

3. **CertificationManager.clar**  
   Stores and verifies ethical certifications (e.g., fair trade, organic). Allows third-party auditors to validate certifications.

4. **SupplyChainTracker.clar**  
   Tracks product lifecycle stages (e.g., raw material, manufacturing, distribution). Logs updates immutably.

5. **AuthenticityVerifier.clar**  
   Verifies product authenticity by checking hashes and supply chain records. Generates QR codes for consumer access.

6. **AuditLog.clar**  
   Provides auditors with read-only access to supply chain data and certifications. Logs audit requests for transparency.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/supply-chain-transparency.git
   ```

2. **Deploy Smart Contracts**  
   Use the Stacks CLI to deploy the Clarity contracts to the Stacks blockchain.  
   ```bash
   clarinet deploy
   ```

3. **Interact with the Platform**  
   - Suppliers: Call `register-product` in `ProductRegistry.clar` to add products.  
   - Manufacturers: Use `update-stage` in `SupplyChainTracker.clar` to log production steps.  
   - Consumers: Query `get-product-details` in `ProductRegistry.clar` to view product history.  
   - Auditors: Use `get-audit-log` in `AuditLog.clar` to review supply chain data.

## 🔧 Example Workflow

1. A coffee bean supplier registers their product:  
   - Generates a SHA-256 hash of the batch details.  
   - Calls `register-product` with the hash, batch ID, and fair trade certification.  

2. A roaster updates the supply chain:  
   - Calls `update-stage` to log roasting details and factory location.  

3. A retailer sells the coffee:  
   - Registers the final product with a QR code linked to the blockchain record.  

4. A consumer scans the QR code:  
   - Queries `get-product-details` to view the coffee’s journey and certifications.  

5. An auditor verifies compliance:  
   - Uses `get-audit-log` to review the supply chain and certifications.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Layer-1 blockchain with Bitcoin security).  
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity (secure, predictable language for Stacks).  
- **Frontend (Optional)**: React + Tailwind CSS for a consumer-facing dashboard.  
- **Tools**: Stacks CLI, Clarinet for contract development and testing.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

This platform addresses real-world issues by:  
- Ensuring ethical sourcing through transparent, immutable records.  
- Preventing counterfeit goods with verifiable product IDs.  
- Empowering consumers to make informed, ethical purchasing decisions.  
- Simplifying regulatory compliance for businesses and auditors.
